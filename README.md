## How this app was built
The recipe app was built using an HTML/JavaScript frontend and Python/Flask backend. It also uses a PostgreSQL database to store the user's data and recipes.
All recipes on this app are populated from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

## Why I made this app
I very much enjoy cooking and am always looking for new recipes. This app allows me to find new recipes and keep track of all of them in one place. I have given other's access to the app to create profiles and save recipes if they would like to. If you are on the look out for new recipes, then give it a try.
